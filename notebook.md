- Used hardhat boiler plate code to get started
- configured metamask to use local hardhat network
    - Need to add a custom network and make sure to use the appropiate chainId so as to not bring up any errors during transactions.  
- tested deployment of one escrow contract within the project. 

Things to do:
- Think of ways of incorporating the native token of the project as a form of financial incentive. Read about the tokenomics of this approach. 
- Work on the ui elements of creating the escrow connections between users. 
- save contracts created using a simple node js api. 
- show all contracts created to the user. filter contracts list based on a user's address.
